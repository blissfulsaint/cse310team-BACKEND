# Class Roulette
# CSE310 Team Backend
# Overview

This is a project completed by a team of engineers. Through creating this project, we hope to explore tools that are available to us as well as learn new languages. Professors can use this software in order to be able to randomly select a student for various reasons, such as saying a prayer or answering a question. When they go to the website, professors can add a class and its students, then press the "Select Student" button to have the program randomly select a student from the list.

# Development Environment

This backend software will be using Javascript. We will then be using MongoDB to host the backend software. The API is on Render.

# Future Work

- Something to add in the future would be having the program display confetti after a student is chosen.
- We could also allow users to change the color theme with options, such as dark and light mode.
- In the future, there could be an input area to allow professors to input the number of students they want to select.
