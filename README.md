# Class Roulette (Backend)
## Overview

This is a project completed by a team of engineers. Through creating this project, we hope to explore tools that are available to us as well as learn new languages. Professors can use this software in order to be able to randomly select a student for various reasons, such as saying a prayer or answering a question. When they go to the website, professors can add a class and its students, then press the "Select Student" button to have the program randomly select a student from the list.

## Development Environment

This backend uses Node.js to communicate with MongoDB and relay data to and from our [frontend application](https://github.com/blissfulsaint/classroulette). The API is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/).

## Future Work

- Something to add in the future would be to optimize the database so retrieval of data is faster when first loading the webpage.
- We could also try caching in the backend to improve the loading time.
- Another thing to edit in the future would be to run a scalability test to ensure the application does not run out of memory.
